# Titanic Survival Prediction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Challenge Overview:-

In this challenge, Aim to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

Dataset:-

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It includes the following features:

Name: Passenger's name

Age: Passenger's age

Gender: Passenger's gender (male/female)

Socio-economic Class (Pclass): Passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Analysis:-

We will explore the dataset to understand patterns and factors that influenced survival rates. Then, we will build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival based on passenger characteristics.

Interactive Content:-

You can interact with the analysis and predictive model using the following resources:-
