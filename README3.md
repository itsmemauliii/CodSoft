# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Project Overview

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent activities in the credit card industry pose significant financial risks, and detecting them promptly is crucial for maintaining trust and security in financial transactions.

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains a collection of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It comprises X records with Y attributes.

## Analysis

In this project, we explore the dataset to understand the characteristics of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. We preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and split it into training and testing sets. Then, we train multiple machine learning models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict fraudulent transactions.
